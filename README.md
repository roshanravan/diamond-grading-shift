# The Evolving Landscape of Diamond Grading: A New Chapter for Lab-Grown Gems

The world of diamonds is undergoing a significant transformation, particularly concerning how lab-grown diamonds are evaluated and perceived. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA), long regarded as the industry's most respected gemological authority and the creator of the universal 4Cs grading system, recently announced a pivotal change in its approach to grading these man-made stones. This shift marks a clear effort to distinguish lab-grown diamonds from their natural counterparts, reflecting their different origins, market dynamics, and underlying value propositions.

- The **4Cs system** was designed for natural rarity.  
- Early GIA reports: ranges only.  
- **2019**: “Synthetic” dropped.  
- **2020**: Full 4Cs grading online.  
- **2025 Change**: GIA stops 4Cs for LGDs.  
  - New: **Premium** / **Standard**.  
  - Below threshold → no grade.  

**How Premium/Standard Will Work**  
- The new GIA system confirms the stone is a laboratory-grown diamond.  
- It then assigns one of two categories: **Premium** or **Standard**.  
- Categories are based on a combination of **color, clarity, and finish**.  
- Diamonds failing to meet minimum GIA standards receive **no designation**.  
- Rationale:  
  - 95% of LGDs are already F-color or better, VVS clarity.  
  - The 4Cs continuum of
